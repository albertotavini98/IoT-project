# IoT-project
The project for the Internet of Things course at Politecnico di Milano. 
It is an implementation using TinyOS (a C based operative system for small devices) and Tossim python simulation to create and test a system where the nodes emulate devices and the code is meant to allow comunication without incurring in the well known "hidden node" problem.
See report for more detail on the approach.
