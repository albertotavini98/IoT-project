# IoT-project
The project for the Internet of Things course at Politecnico di Milano. 

It is an implementation to create and test a system where the nodes emulate devices and the code is meant to allow comunication without incurring in the well known "hidden node" problem.
It emulates a real network using TinyOS (a C based operative system for small devices) and Tossim python simulation.

See report for more detail on the approach.
